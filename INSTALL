Bluestniff INSTALL
7/31/2003

This is Bluesniff 0.1.  It's really rough.  I seriously hope you know what 
you're doing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
This has only been tested on RedHat 9 with a stock kernel.  If you find
any problems on other platforms, please let me (gdead@shmoo.com) know.

In order to use Bluesniff, you must first have a working bluetooth card.
Check out http://bluez.sourceforge.net/ for a list of supported cards,
installation instructions for the bluetooth drivers, and lots of other 
groovy bluetooth tools.

Then, you need to install redfang, a bluetooth brute force MAC guessing
tool.  Check out http://www.atstake.com/ for redfang code and instructions
for getting it working.

Finally you need Curses::Application.  See http://www.cpan.org/ for you
Perl-y needs
