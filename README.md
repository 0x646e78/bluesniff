This is Bluesniff 0.1.  It's really rough.  I seriously hope you know what 
you're doing

About
-----

Bluesniff is a proof of concept bluetooth device discovery tool.  Bluesniff
can be concidered a bluetooth wardriver of sorts.  It is meant to raise
awareness of BT security issues and likely has a lot of room for improvement.

Bluesniff can look for BT devices in one of two modes:

Normal Scan - Looks only for devices that are discoverable

Brute Force Scan - uses redfang to brute force guess MAC addresses.  If 
you're targeting a specific device, see http://bluesniff.shmoo.com/ for
a list of MAC prefixes for common devices

The UI is really straight forward.  I'll maybe write up something about it
later.
